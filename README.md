# Car-Emissions-Notebook

## Model Evaluation and Validation
## Project: Predicting Emission of CO

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Car Emission Prediction.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the `Car_emission.csv` dataset file to complete your work , you will see implemented functionality requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Car Emission Prediction.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Car Emission Prediction.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified Emission dataset in the notebook consists of clean data that required for the prediction process.

**Features**
1. `Imperial Extra-Urban`: MPG (miles per gallon).

**Target Variable**
2. `Emissions CO [mg/km]`: Emission factors (mg/km) of CO
